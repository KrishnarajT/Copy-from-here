# Copy-from-here
A simple website to host a file that would contain anything that I want to share with my friends or anyone anywhere, relying on surge for deployment. 

# [Visit the Website](http://cpfromkrish.surge.sh)

# How this works.
1. The way this works, is that there is a local file called `stuff_to_copy.txt` which is empty, and can be replaced with anything you want. 
2. After doing that, you are supposed to just run surge, and surge will then deploy it immediately on its servers, ready for any perosn to access. 
3. They now have access to whatever you wanted to share. 
4. This process is repeated every time I wanna share something. For some reason, I find it easier to just ask someone to go to your website, rather than to visit regprime, and enter a code.

# Limitations. 
1. I cannot share different things with different people. The one thing I do share will always be visible to everyone. 
2. Not Secure. Doesnt need to be, but could be.
